# Python notebooks for deep learning

This repo contains some notebooks for exploring/studying deep learning algorithms.

## YOLO

Python notebook: [yolo.ipynb](https://github.com/viirya/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/yolo.ipynb)

I also put the notebook to run on Google Colaboratory ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18hHbizWmKRf_4Gt-bXZYaQPdSRzaWco2/view?usp=sharing)). You can use free GPU resource to test the code.

* Good example on kaggle: [YOLO for detection of bounding boxes - TensorFlow](https://www.kaggle.com/vijaybj/yolo-for-detection-of-bounding-boxes-tensorflow/code)
  
  yolo.ipynb is copied from this example. I just added some comments into the codes. It is well explaining how to create a YOLO network and prepare training data especially bounding box ground truth. Though it simplies a few places, e.g. it only detects a single kind of object, in other words, there are more class predictions. It's still a very good example letting me understand some points I don't get it by reading other tutorials.
